# Overview

Now you can test any buildpacks (3rd party, or your own) with cf-vagrant-installer

How does it help? 
- It eliminates the need to run full blown Cloud Foundry deployment for trying/testing/validating/distributing your buildpack

Who can benefit?
- Developers of custom buildpacks
- Anyone who wants to know if a Buildpack X would work on Cloud Foundry
- Software vendors who want to open get their products (in the form of buildpacks) to more users - this offers

What are the use cases?
- Developing and testing buildpacks
- Training: Getting anyone new to Cloud Foundry to try it out with any buildpack
- Marketing: Distribute your custom buildpacks (for example IBM Liberty) as a one click installer
